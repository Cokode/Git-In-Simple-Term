Now lets go..

1. Open your terminal: On Mac OS, press Command + Spacebar, type "Terminal," and hit Enter. This will open the terminal.

2. Navigate to the desired location for your project: If you want to create a working directory on your desktop, use the "cd" command followed by "Desktop" (e.g., `cd Desktop`) and press Enter.

3. Create a working directory: Use the "mkdir" command followed by the desired directory name (e.g., `mkdir CollinsApp`) and press Enter. This will create a folder named "CollinsApp" on your desktop.

4 After creating your project directory, initialize it as a Git directory. This enables Git to track changes and provides access to its powerful features for project management.

To initialize the directory as a Git repository, open the terminal and navigate to your project folder. Use the command `git init` to initialize Git within that directory.

Once initialized, Git will start monitoring the directory for any changes you make to the files. You can then leverage Git's capabilities to effectively track and manage your project.

By following these steps, you will successfully initialize your project directory as a Git repository, allowing you to take advantage of Git's powerful features for version control and project management.
